name: Stability Sprints Plan
sprint_duration: 2w
notes: >-
  Six prioritized sprints optimized for fastest path to acceptance checks.
  Estimates are ideal days; adjust per team capacity. All dependencies respected.

sprints:
  - key: Sprint-1
    goal: Foundations — targets, budgets, fixed-step loop, determinism toggle, rendering decision.
    tickets: [STAB-001, STAB-002, STAB-003, STAB-004, STAB-005, STAB-006, STAB-010]
    total_estimate: 13d
    risks:
      - Team alignment on SLOs and budgets may require extra iteration
      - Rendering stack decision may impact later task scopes

  - key: Sprint-2
    goal: Core infra — frame graph MVP, shader toolchain, tech selections, logging.
    tickets: [STAB-008, STAB-011, STAB-012, STAB-013, STAB-039]
    total_estimate: 14d
    risks:
      - Shader toolchain validation across platforms could spill over
      - Frame graph MVP may reveal hidden dependencies

  - key: Sprint-3
    goal: Render robustness start — golden images, device-loss handler, time utils, allocators.
    tickets: [STAB-033, STAB-019, STAB-015, STAB-021]
    total_estimate: 12d
    risks:
      - Device-loss recovery can be vendor/driver sensitive
      - Golden image baselines across the matrix may be time-consuming

  - key: Sprint-4
    goal: Assets and camera — deterministic packs, runtime loaders, camera model, repro capture.
    tickets: [STAB-025, STAB-027, STAB-017, STAB-041]
    total_estimate: 12d
    risks:
      - KTX2/meshopt toolchain compatibility
      - Reversed-Z integration may require material/Depth fixes

  - key: Sprint-5
    goal: Determinism & perf gates — physics determinism, record/replay, perf dashboards.
    tickets: [STAB-030, STAB-032, STAB-034, STAB-051]
    total_estimate: 12d
    risks:
      - Physics determinism flakes under broadphase/joint configs
      - Perf gates tuning may initially be noisy

  - key: Sprint-6
    goal: Acceptance path — soak tests, importer fuzzing, enable determinism in CI, acceptance stage.
    tickets: [STAB-037, STAB-028, STAB-047, STAB-057]
    total_estimate: 15d
    risks:
      - Soak tests surface long-tail leaks; schedule buffer for fixes
      - Fuzzing may uncover high-severity issues impacting scope
