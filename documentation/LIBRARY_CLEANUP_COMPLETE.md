## Archived Documents

**Moved to `Polylog6/docs/archive/`:**
1. ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md - Visual brief alignment analysis
2. CORRECTED_VISUAL_BRIEF.md - Corrected visual brief
3. DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT.md - Documentation consolidation plan
4. FINAL_BLOCKER_CHECK.md - Old blocker verification
5. VISUAL_BRIEF_ALIGNMENT_ANALYSIS.md - Visual analysis
6. VISUAL_GENERATION_HANDOFF.md - Handoff to Gamma workspace

**Why Archived:**
- Handoff documents (no longer needed after Gamma workspace)
- Old status documents (superseded by EXECUTION_READY.md)
- Planning documents (superseded by OPTIMIZED_PHASE_2_PLAN.md)
- Kept for historical reference but not active
