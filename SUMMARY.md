# Development Summary

## Completed

✅ **Codebase Reorganization**: Archived 110+ legacy files, clean professional structure
✅ **Visual Testing Setup**: Workspace browser testing (`test:visual:workspace`)
✅ **CI/CD Verification**: GitHub Actions active, Codecov/Mergify configured
✅ **Documentation Consolidation**: Single reference file (`CONSOLIDATED_REFERENCE.md`)
✅ **Automated Testing**: Engine validation script, integration planning
✅ **Folding Module**: Created stub for missing module

## Current Status

**Phase 1: Engine Validation** (In Progress)
- Folding module created but import issues remain
- Python tests need investigation
- Frontend tests require npm setup

## Next Steps

1. Fix folding module import path issues
2. Resolve Python test failures
3. Set up npm for frontend tests
4. Validate all engines pass
5. Proceed to Phase 2: Pre-computation (scalar variants, attachment patterns)

## Integration Roadmap

See `docs/INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md` for full plan. Next phase focuses on pre-computing 485 scalar variants and 750 attachment patterns for full library support.
