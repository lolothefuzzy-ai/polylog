# Handoff to Windsurf — Template

This file is generated by Cursor when transitioning to Windsurf due to credit constraints or user directive.

## Goal

Cursor cannot continue due to credits or user directive. Windsurf should take over.

## State Recap

(Reference `state/checkpoint.md` for full details)

## Required Code Files to Review

- `scripts/automated_test_suite.py` - Main test runner
- `scripts/run_backend_stability_tests.py` - Backend stability tests
- `src/frontend/tests/visual/backend-stability.spec.js` - Backend stability tests
- `src/frontend/tests/visual/backend-integration-stability.spec.js` - Integration tests
- `src/frontend/tests/integration/backend-frontend-integration.spec.js` - Frontend integration tests
- `src/frontend/tests/integration/full-system-integration.spec.js` - Full system tests

## Tasks Windsurf Should Perform

1. Review current state in `state/checkpoint.md`
2. Review next steps in `state/next-steps.md`
3. Continue with highest priority tasks
4. Update checkpoint after completing work

## Suggested Prompts for Windsurf

- "Please continue implementing automated test suite validation using the structure described in `state/next-steps.md`"
- "Review and test the process management fixes in `scripts/automated_test_suite.py`"
- "Verify Windows compatibility of subprocess handling"

## Warnings

- Process management uses `atexit` and signal handlers - verify Windows compatibility
- Test suite requires both API (port 8000) and frontend (port 5173) servers
- All API endpoints have been corrected - do not revert to old paths

## Code Patterns to Follow

- Use global process references with cleanup handlers for subprocess management
- Health endpoint is `/health` (not `/api/health`)
- Tier 0 endpoint is `/tier0/symbols/{symbol}` (not `/api/tier0/decode/`)
- Always update `state/checkpoint.md` after major changes
- Always update `state/next-steps.md` with immediate next actions

## Open TODO Items

See `cursor/tasks.md` for current task list.
