✅ SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION ANALYSIS COMPLETE
Key Insight: Build on Complete Foundation, Not Incremental Features
Problem with Original Plan:

Frontend starts with minimal features
Integration issues discovered late
Multiple iterations needed
Doesn't leverage full polyhedra library
Optimized Solution:

Pre-compute scalar variants (485 total)
Pre-compute attachment patterns (750 total)
Build frontend with FULL library (1,332 items)
Enable all attachment options from day one
Add runtime generation on top of stable foundation
Optimization Strategy
1. Scalar Variants (1 hour)
Generate k=1,2,3,4,5 for all 97 polyhedra
Result: 485 variants
Enables edge length scaling without constraint
Output: catalogs/tier1/scalar_variants.jsonl
2. Attachment Patterns (2 hours)
Generate ~750 common patterns
Types: Linear, triangular, hexagonal, cubic, tetrahedral
Enables pattern-based assembly
Output: catalogs/tier1/attachment_patterns.jsonl
3. Complete Attachment Matrix (1 hour)
Compute fold angles for all scalar variant pairs
Result: ~47,000 valid pairs
Enables fast lookup for all attachments
Output: catalogs/attachments/attachment_matrix_full.json
4. Frontend with Full Library (4-5 hours)
PolyhedraLibrary: Browse 97 + 485 items
WorkspaceCanvas: THREE.js rendering
AttachmentValidator: Real-time validation
PatternLibrary: Browse 750 patterns
LODSwitcher: 4 LOD levels
Main Workspace: Integrated components
5. API & Service Updates (1 hour)
New endpoints for scalar variants
New endpoints for attachment patterns
Service methods for frontend
