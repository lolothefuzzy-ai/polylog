# Polylog6 Integration Roadmap

## Current System Status

### ✅ Implemented
- Polyform generator with attachment validation
- Unicode compression encoding
- Storage system integration
- 3D visualization (Babylon.js)
- API endpoints for generation
- Visual testing framework

### 🔄 Next Integration Steps

#### Phase 1: Engine Validation (Current)
- Validate all engine structures
- Run comprehensive test suite
- Verify API endpoints
- Test storage persistence

#### Phase 2: Advanced Generation
- Multi-polygon generation (3+ polygons)
- Seed-based generation from discovered polyforms
- Exponential growth modes
- Pattern detection integration

#### Phase 3: Tier Promotion System
- Tier 2 → Tier 3 promotion
- Stability threshold validation
- Closure detection
- Symbol registry updates

#### Phase 4: Full Workspace Integration
- Interactive 3D manipulation
- Drag-and-drop polygon placement
- Real-time attachment validation
- Visual feedback systems

#### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Image detection integration
- Pattern discovery engine
- Telemetry and monitoring
- Performance optimization

## Higher-Order Integration Points

### From Documentation Analysis
- **Seed-Based Generation**: Use discovered polyforms as seeds for exponential generation
- **Pattern Detection**: Integrate image detection for polyform discovery
- **Tier System**: Implement full tier promotion pipeline (Tier 0 → 1 → 2 → 3)
- **Unicode Allocation**: Expand symbol registry for 40,000+ polyforms
- **LOD System**: Implement full level-of-detail switching for performance

## Validation Criteria

Each integration step requires:
1. ✅ All tests passing
2. ✅ API endpoints functional
3. ✅ Storage persistence working
4. ✅ Visual tests passing
5. ✅ Performance targets met

## Automation

Tests run automatically on:
- File changes (watch mode)
- Before commits (pre-commit hooks)
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
