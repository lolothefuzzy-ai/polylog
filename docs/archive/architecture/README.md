# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains Claude's high-level planning and architectural designs.

## Purpose

Claude (the architect) writes planning documents here. Cursor (the implementer) reads these documents and translates them into code.

## Structure

- High-level system designs
- Component architecture
- Data flow diagrams
- Integration plans
- Design decisions

## Current Documents

- `POLYLOG6_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Main system architecture

## Workflow

1. Claude creates architecture documents here
2. Cursor reads and implements based on these plans
3. Blockers and ambiguities are documented in `/state/next-steps.md`
